# Task Processing Rules

This document outlines the standard process for implementing tasks in the Task Tracker application. These rules should be followed for every task to ensure consistent quality and progress tracking.

## Pre-Implementation Checklist

1. **Check Planning Documents**

   - Review `docs/next-planning.md` to understand the feature requirements
   - Identify dependencies and prerequisites for the task
   - Confirm the feature aligns with the overall application architecture

2. **Task Preparation**
   - Break down the task into smaller, manageable steps
   - Identify the components and files that need to be modified
   - Determine any new dependencies that need to be installed

## Implementation Process

1. **Development**

   - Follow TypeScript best practices and maintain type safety
   - Use consistent code style that matches the existing codebase
   - Implement components using Shadcn UI when appropriate
   - Write clean, maintainable code with proper comments

2. **Testing**

   - Test the implementation immediately after completion
   - Verify functionality in different scenarios (edge cases)
   - Check for any regressions in existing features
   - Ensure responsive design works across different screen sizes

3. **Self-Improvement**
   - Document any challenges faced during implementation
   - Note any patterns or solutions that could be reused
   - Identify areas for improvement in the implementation process
   - Apply lessons learned to future tasks

## Post-Implementation Checklist

1. **Documentation**

   - Update the planning document to mark the task as completed
   - Add any relevant notes or considerations for future reference
   - Document any API changes or new components added

2. **Quality Assurance**

   - Verify that the implementation meets all requirements
   - Check for any potential performance issues
   - Ensure proper error handling is in place
   - Validate accessibility considerations

3. **Continuous Improvement**
   - Refactor code if necessary for better maintainability
   - Identify any technical debt created and plan for addressing it
   - Share knowledge gained with the team (if applicable)

## Task Tracking

For each completed task:

1. Update the status in the planning document
2. Add a brief summary of what was implemented
3. Note any deviations from the original plan and the reasons

By following these rules consistently, we ensure high-quality implementation, maintain good documentation, and continuously improve our development process.
