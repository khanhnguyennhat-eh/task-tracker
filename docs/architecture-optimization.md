# Task Tracker Architecture Optimization

## Overview

This document outlines the architectural improvements made to the Task Tracker application to reduce redundancy, improve code reusability, and establish better patterns for maintainability.

## Core Improvements

### 1. Centralized Status Formatting

**Problem:** Status formatting logic was duplicated across multiple components.

**Solution:** Centralized all status-related formatting functions in `src/lib/utils.ts`:

- `formatStatus()`: Converts enum values to user-friendly strings
- `getStatusVariant()`: Returns the appropriate badge variant for each status
- `getStatusColor()`: Returns Tailwind CSS classes for Kanban columns
- `getNextStatus()`: Determines the next status in the workflow sequence

This eliminates redundant code and ensures consistent status representation throughout the application.

### 2. Task Updates Management

**Problem:** Task data refresh logic was duplicated and inconsistently implemented.

**Solution:** Created an enhanced `useTaskUpdates` hook in `src/lib/use-task-updates.ts` that:

- Provides configurable auto-refresh functionality
- Offers manual refresh capabilities
- Unifies the refresh pattern across components

### 3. Task Filtering Logic

**Problem:** Filter implementation was duplicated between KanbanBoard and TaskGrid components.

**Solution:** Created a dedicated `useTaskFiltering` hook in `src/lib/useTaskFiltering.ts` that:

- Manages filter state (search query, status filter)
- Applies filters consistently
- Integrates with URL parameters
- Provides filter reset functionality

### 4. URL Parameter Management

**Problem:** URL parameter handling needed optimization.

**Solution:** Improved the `useTaskFilterParams` hook in `src/lib/use-task-filter-params.ts` to:

- Prevent unnecessary URL updates
- Validate parameter values
- Make URL sharing more reliable
- Improve code readability with better comments

## Benefits

1. **Reduced Code Duplication:** Eliminated redundant status formatting, filtering, and refresh logic.

2. **Improved Maintainability:** Centralized related functionality into dedicated hooks and utilities.

3. **Better User Experience:** More consistent behavior across different views.

4. **Enhanced Performance:** Removed unnecessary re-renders and state updates.

5. **Future-Proofing:** The modular architecture makes it easier to add new features or modify existing ones.

## Future Recommendations

1. **State Management:** Consider implementing a more robust state management solution like Zustand for complex state.

2. **Component Abstraction:** Further modularize UI components into smaller, more specialized pieces.

3. **API Layer:** Create a dedicated API client layer to centralize API calls and error handling.

4. **Caching Strategy:** Implement SWR or React Query for more efficient data fetching and caching.

5. **Testing:** Add comprehensive test coverage using React Testing Library and Jest.
