## Overview

A web application to track software engineering tasks through predefined stages with status tracking and notes.

## User Stories

1. As a user, I want to create new tasks with descriptions
2. As a user, I want to view all my tasks at a glance
3. As a user, I want to update the status of tasks (Investigation, Planning, In Progress, In Testing, In Review, Done)
4. As a user, I want to add notes for each status change
5. As a user, I want to complete a PR checklist for tasks in the review stage
6. As a user, I want to filter/search tasks based on status or text
7. As a user, I want data to persist between sessions (local storage)
8. As a user, I want a clean, intuitive UI that's easy to use

### 7. Data Persistence

- [ ] Implement local storage saving
- [ ] Add automatic saving on any data change
- [ ] Create data load function on page initialization
- [ ] Include error handling for storage issues

### 8. UI/UX Design

- [ ] Add subtle animations for better user experience

## Technical Stack

- HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (Vanilla JS for simplicity)
- LocalStorage for data persistence
- No backend required initially
- Potential future expansion: Backend API, database

## Implementation Plan

1. Set up project structure
2. Create basic HTML/CSS layout
3. Implement core task creation and display
4. Add status management functionality
5. Implement notes system
6. Create PR checklist functionality
7. Add filtering and search capabilities
8. Implement local storage persistence
9. Polish UI/UX
10. Test and refine
