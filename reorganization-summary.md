# Project Reorganization Summary

## Changes Made

1. Removed the nested `nextjs-app` directory

   - Confirmed it only contained a `.git` directory and `.next` build directory that didn't need to be preserved

2. Fixed the main page

   - Updated empty `page.tsx` with content from `page.tsx.new`
   - Removed the redundant `page.tsx.new` file

3. Updated the package.json

   - Changed the project name from "nextjs-app" to "task-tracker"
   - Confirmed all scripts were correctly configured

4. Updated documentation

   - Enhanced the README.md with detailed project information
   - Updated the next-planning.md file to reflect completed work
   - Added project structure refactoring section
   - Added remaining tasks section

5. Removed redundant files

   - Deleted `app.js` from the original implementation
   - Deleted `index.html` from the original implementation
   - Deleted `styles.css` from the original implementation
   - Converted `next.config.ts` to standard `next.config.js` format
   - Removed the `backup` directory with unnecessary build files

6. Verified the application
   - Started the development server successfully
   - Confirmed the application builds and runs correctly

## Project Structure

The project now has a cleaner structure:

```
task-tracker/
├── prisma/             # Database schema and seeds
├── public/             # Static assets
├── src/                # Source code
│   ├── app/            # Next.js App Router
│   │   ├── api/        # API routes
│   │   └── page.tsx    # Main page
│   ├── components/     # React components
│   │   ├── ui/         # Shadcn UI components
│   │   └── ...         # Task-specific components
│   └── lib/            # Utility functions and types
├── .next/              # Next.js build output (gitignored)
├── node_modules/       # Dependencies (gitignored)
├── next-planning.md    # Planning document for Next.js version
├── planning.md         # Original planning document
├── README.md           # Project documentation

```

## Remaining Tasks

1. UI/UX Enhancements:

   - Dark/light mode toggle
   - Toast notifications for actions

2. Features Enhancements:

   - URL query parameters for sharing filtered views
   - Task priority levels

3. Deployment & Optimization:
   - Environment variables
   - Production optimization
   - Error boundaries
   - SEO optimization

## Next Steps

You can now continue development on the clean, reorganized project structure. The application is fully functional, and you can focus on implementing the remaining features and optimizations.
